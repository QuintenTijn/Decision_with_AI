1; Code: Add ABF & runningTime to the table in exercise 2
2; Code: Make exercise 5
3; Code: Check if the last 4 box plots of exercise 3 are correct
4; Code: Run all code in one sitting to get final plots

5; Report: Task 1: Add the default parameter of the initial GA the plot of the best fitness at 
each iteration.
6; Report: Task 2: Add table of combinations of cross, mut, sel with ABF and runtime
7; Report: Task 2: Add boxplots and ABF plot
8; Report: Task 2: Decide on and motivate the optimal combination of cross, mut, sel
8; Report: Task 3: Add table of mut, cross probability combinations with fitness scores
9; Report: Task 3: Add boxplots and ABF plot
10; Report: Task 3: Decide on and motivate the optimal combination of mut, cross probability
11; Report: Task 4: Add description of decorator implementation
12; Report: Task 5: Add PetriNet visualisation
13; Report: Task 5: Describe final solution

... 
Last step; run all code in order one final time to make sure the notebook functions. DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING AFTER THAT POINT.
