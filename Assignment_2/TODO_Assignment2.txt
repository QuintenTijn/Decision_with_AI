# ACTION POINTS

## Code
1. Everyone: Review all code and ensure it's AI-compatible
2. Complete code implementation
3. Do Final code run

## Report
1. Celine: Write a brief description explaining how CNNs solve the given task
2. Yannick & Tijn: Report on initial tests with the CNN before hyperparameter optimization
    -Include learning curves from the initial training
3. Celine: Write a brief description of how the chosen hyperparameter optimization tool improves the CNN
4. Celine: Document the selected hyperparameters to optimize, including:
    - Define their search space
    - Provide justification for choices
5. Tijn & Yannick: Report on results with the CNN after hyperparameter optimization
    - Include learning curves for both training and validation phases
    - Tijn & Yannick: Compare and analyze results between pre- and post-optimization performance
